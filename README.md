Stock Portfolio Generator developed with Java to minimize inefficiencies associated with the indexed fund model

See how I embrace random walk theory to generate stock portfolios. These portfolios mimic indexed funds such 
as the S&P 500 while minimizing the inefficiencies associated with them. Popular stock index funds are artificially 
inflated when they join an index and are rapidly purchased in high quantities around the market.
